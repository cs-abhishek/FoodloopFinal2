                        FoodLoop is a government-funded initiative designed to address the growing problem of food waste. The platform connects restaurants, weddings, events, and other food providers with NGOs, communities, and individuals in need. Instead of letting surplus food go to waste, FoodLoop facilitates its donation to those who need it most, ensuring that food reaches the right people at the right time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        Our mission is to make food donation easier, faster, and more efficient, while also ensuring that donors are rewarded for their generosity. With minimal effort, restaurants and event organizers can donate excess food, and in return, the government provides them with a small incentive for their contribution to reducing food waste.
